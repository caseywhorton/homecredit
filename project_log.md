# Project Log

## Date: 2025-10-20

Created code snippets in Jupyter notebooks for creating bucketed categorical features.  
Created transformation pipeline logic.  
Saved preprocessing pipeline to `artifacts` directory.  
Added `artifacts` directory to dvc tracking.

## Date: 2025-10-21

Trialed a few ML algorithms on dataset.  
Features have Nulls/NaN.  
Used a random forest classifier for first iteration, massively overfit to the data.  
Will look at the NaN in the dataset again and clean it further.

Looked at decision trees - overfitting or underfitting.  
Used a random forest on 3 input features, underfitting.  
Added a vibe-coded SHAP value section, still evaluating.

## Date: 2025-11-04

Reperformed SHAP value section  
Saved new preprocessing artifact  
Saved model artifact
